# SEMES

This project seeks to create a OpenSource Accounting System with a scalable backend and a responsive front end. This porject was originally created to tailor the needs of Semes, a company from Ecuator seeking to distribute potable water. Throught the United NationðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³ this company's needs was brought to our sight and the opportunity to create an OpenSource Accounting system was born.

### United Nation Goas and Our Goals ðŸŒŽ

Smartphone prolifaration of digital technologies is not a phenomenon isolated for the developing world ðŸ“±. The Pew Research Center estimates recorded an increment to 39% in 2018 from the 28% in 2015 among the population younger than 50 years old of Nigeria(https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/02/05/smartphone-ownership-is-growing-rapidly-around-the-world-but-not-always-equally/). On a diferent note, on 'Poor Economics', Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo suggest that new financial products ðŸ’° are key for lifting people out of poverty. Our hope is that this product will contribute to the economic development of marginalized communities. 

This project seeks to contribute to financial services that the poor all arround the world can benefit from today. Small buisness owners in the develeloping world can use this service (free and automated) to keep track of their accounting as well as to get some key insight in their buisness. Our hope is that this project will unlock new possibilities to small buisness owners all around the world. This story start with Semes.ðŸŽ‰

When contributing please remember the many coonstrains that technology in the developing wolrd may suffer from. Low bandwidths, unrelaiable communication, and obsolete smartphones to name a few. Please join our Discord channel with any question, comment or complain. We want to create a community of developers that seek to help the world with code.

To overcome some of the technical difficulties when developing applications on the developing world some key resources are the following:

Android Go Edition 
This version of android arrived on 2018 with the focus of targetting emerging markets. Among the advantages of this operating system is the reduced size of the OS as well as memory optimezed apps that run on devices with less than 2GB of ram and a limited storage. Read the guidlines to develop on this OS.
