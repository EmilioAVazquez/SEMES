# SEMES

This project seeks to create a OpenSource Accounting System with a scalable backend and a responsive front end. This porject was originally created to tailor the needs of Semes, a company from Ecuator seeking to distribute potable water. Throught the United Nation this company's needs was brought to our sight and the opportunity to create an OpenSource Accounting system was born.

### United Nation Goas and Our Goals ðŸŒŽ

On 'Poor Economics', Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo aregues that new fianncial products are key for the development of the poor. Products like this will contribute to the economic development of marginalized communities. 

This project seeks to contribute to financial services that the poor all arround the world can benefit from. Small buisness owners in the develeloping world can use this service (free and automated) to keep track of their accounting as well as to get some key insight in their buisness. Our hope is that this project will unlock new possibilities to small buisness owners all around the world. This story start with Semes.

### How to to contribute?
